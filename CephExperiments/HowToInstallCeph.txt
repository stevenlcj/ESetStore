Note that the following commands are executed in Ubuntu 16.04.

Suppose you have four machines with IP and hostname:

192.168.0.100  host00

192.168.0.101  host01

192.168.0.102  host02

192.168.0.102  host03

Run the following commands on host00:

$wget -q -O- 'https://download.ceph.com/keys/release.asc' | sudo apt-key add -

$echo deb https://download.ceph.com/debian-mimic/ $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list

$sudo echo "${USER} ALL = (root) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/t716

$sudo apt update

$sudo apt install ceph-deploy

$mkdir my-cluster

$cd my-cluster

$ceph-deploy new host00

$ceph-deploy install host00 host01 host02 host03

$ceph-deploy admin host00

$ceph-deploy mgr create host00 host01

------------------

If no error, you should have ceph installed on four machines now.

Run 'sudo ceph -s' to check the status of ceph
