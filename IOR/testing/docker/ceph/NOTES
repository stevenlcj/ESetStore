Following are basic notes on how to deploy the 'ceph/demo' docker container. The 'ceph/demo' container bootstraps a complete Ceph cluster with all necessary daemons already running, providing a convenient environment for evaluating the correctness of the RADOS backend for IOR, in our case.

##########################
# Pull 'ceph/demo' image #
##########################

Run `docker pull ceph/demo` to download the image to your system.

################################
# Deploy 'ceph/demo' conatiner #
################################

To deploy the Ceph cluster, execute the following command:

`docker run -it --net=host -v /etc/ceph:/etc/ceph -e MON_IP=10.0.0.1 -e CEPH_PUBLIC_NETWORK=10.0.0.0/24 ceph/demo`

The only necessary modification to the above command is to provide the correct network IP address for MON_IP and to provide the corresponding CIDR notation of this IP for CEPH_PUBLIC_NETWORK, as illustrated.

NOTE: The above command starts the docker container in interactive mode. Replace '-it' with '-d' to run in the background as a daemon.

###############################
# Run IOR against 'ceph/demo' #
###############################

With a Ceph cluster now deployed, running IOR against it is straightforward:

`./ior -a RADOS -- -u admin -c /etc/ceph/cephconf -p cephfs_data`

All command line arguments following the '--' are required. 

-u is the Ceph username (e.g., admin)
-c is the Ceph config file (typically found in /etc/ceph/ceph.conf)
-p is the Ceph pool to perform I/O to (e.g., cephfs_data)

NOTE: Permissions of the various config files, keyrings, etc. inside of /etc/ceph may need to be modified to be readable by the user running IOR (e.g., `sudo chmod 644 /etc/ceph/*`). These various files are created internally within the docker container and may not be readable by other users.
